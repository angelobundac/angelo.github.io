        <p>DEAF COMMUNITY</p>
    </div>

    <div class="context-part1">
        <p>The Irish Deaf Community experienced a historic day on December 14, 2017. Irish Sign Language received its first official recognition when the Dáil passed legislation. This marked the end of a huge campaign that was organized by the Irish Deaf Society and involved those with a connection in the Deaf Community.</p>
    </div>

    <class class="context-part2">
        <p>The new law will be a crucial step in ending the years of marginalization that the Deaf Community has experienced. Deaf persons will have the ability to use their native language to access public services according to the Irish Sign Language Act of 2017.</p>
    </class>

    <div class="context-part3">
        <p>Under the Act Irish Sign Language (ISL) is designated as a native and independent language that is used as the primary means of communication by over 5,000 members of the Deaf community.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="context1">
        <p>Is Sign Language Universal?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="context2">
        <p>The answer is no - Irish Sign Language is different from all other sign languages such as British Sign Language, American Sign Language etc.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="history">
        <p><div class ="story">St. Joseph’s School for Deaf Boys has a rich history. Initially, the Irish Christian Brothers couldn't open a residential school for deaf boys due to staffing issues. However, the Catholic Institute for the Deaf stepped in, purchasing a property in Glasnevin and appointing a teacher named Sutton to educate four deaf boys. By 1853, the number of students grew to 70, prompting the need for a larger school. In 1856, a new school was built in Cabra, with the Irish Christian Brothers taking over its management. The school expanded in 1869 with the addition of a new wing.

            In 1862, the school introduced training programs in trades like tailoring, shoe-making, and printing for its students.
            
            While there was a push for oralism in deaf education after the 1880 Milan Congress, St. Joseph’s chose to focus on sign language, as it was preferred by its students. Despite attempts to introduce oralism, the Brothers developed their own teaching methods, emphasizing literacy and written communication.
            
            During Br. E.L S-Alton's leadership from 1882 to 1947, a commission was formed in England to study various teaching methods for the deaf. After visiting schools across England, they concluded that the system used at St. Joseph’s in Dublin produced the best results.</div></p>
